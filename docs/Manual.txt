2. Units in the simulation
===========================
The energy quantities are processed in units of [K]
The size quantities are processed in units of [Angstrom]
For example, LJ epsilon parameter [K], LJ sigma parameter [Angstrom]
Note: epsilon(1,1,2,2) means epsilon between site 1 on molecule type 1 and site 2 on moelcule type 2


=======================================================================
3. "input.in" file 
WARNING: Keep all labels in the input.in file, 
DO NOT change/add/delete labels in input.in file. 
For example, leave the "Pressure [bar]" label even if the 
ensemble is not NPT, the MC program will automatically skip this label.
Variables required under each label are explained.
=======================================================================
Ensemble
    'NVT' - canonical ensemble
    'NPT' - isobaric-isothermal ensemble (current version only allows cubic box and there is no external structure in the box)

    press - Pressure of the system, only effective when
            ensemble is "NPT". Double precision.

    n_box - In the current verison (v1.7), only one box is needed.
            I haven't coded two box version for Gibbs ensemble yet.
            Integer.

Number of Molecule Types
    n_mol_types - Integer.

Maximum Number of Sites on the Molecule
    n_sites_max - Integer.

Mixing Rules
    'Lorentz-Berthelot' - The cross-interaction term will be 
                          automatically calculated.
    'Explicit'          - Cross-interaction parameters should be 
                          explicitly listed in mol.in file. I wrote this 
                          for my conformal sites model project, especially for 
                          Coulombic interactions.

4. Additional Notes
==========================

1). Sequence of molecules in the input files (input.in and mol.in) should be consistent.
2). Random number generator generates uniform random number between [0,1)
